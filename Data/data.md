# Processed Dataset: 

	•	Dataset Source: CovAbDab, a database of annotated antibody sequences interacting with SARS-CoV-2 variants (WT, beta, delta, omicron).
	•	Antigen Similarity: Average sequence similarity between antigens = 0.96 (minor differences).
	•	Antibody Diversity: Average sequence similarity between antibodies = 0.53.
	•	Processing:
	•	Identified antibody-antigen binding and neutralizing pairs.
	•	Focused on antigens with ≥1,000 interacting antibodies, yielding 42,091 pairs.
	•	Variant Distribution: SARS-CoV-2 WT had the most antibodies.
	•	Labels:
	•	Binding and neutralizing.
	•	Binding but not neutralizing.
	•	Neither binding nor neutralizing (neutralizing without binding is impossible).
